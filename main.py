#Use a dictionary to store a product's current price and a price at which you'd be willing to buy them.
#Every day, scrape the page for price changes.
#If the price has changed and it's under your 'I'd buy that for a dollar' price, automate an email to be sent to yourself.
#The email should contain:
#A link to the product
#A reminder of your desired price
#The current price
